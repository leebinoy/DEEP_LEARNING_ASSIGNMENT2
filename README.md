This project is the implementation of CNN using 2 different architectures: ResNet-18 and MobileNet.I have used the CIFAR-10 dataset for  the purpose.
ResNet-18 has an accuracy of 75.66% while MobileNet has an accuracy of 61.21% on CIFAR-10

Accuracy and loss curves are already generated in the notebook for visualization.
The code includes Data Augmentation,Model architecture setup and accuracy/loss curves.
